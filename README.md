# rake-tasks-docker-sync

Additional plugin for [rake-tasks-docker](https://github.com/inviqa/inviqa-rake-tasks-docker) that triggers [docker-sync](https://github.com/Eugenmayer/docker-sync) at the right points.

To use, you should install `docker-sync` separately with:
```bash
gem install docker-sync
```

The docker-sync gem checks for updates itself, so this should be kept up to date automatically.
